    <string name="bio">Hi , my name is Fabian.
    \n\nI love potatoes and cats.
    \n\nAmerican potatoes and calico cats.
    \nLike a cat , I also love to eat fish.
   Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
